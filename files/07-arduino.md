## Assignment
* Interface at least one input and one output device to an embedded board (e.g. Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
* Write a program to read data from the input device and use it to control the output device
* Document your assignment, including screenshots and the program sourcecode, explaining how your program works
* Include original source code files
